# Report for assignment 3

This is a template for your report. You are free to modify it as needed.
It is not required to use markdown for your report either, but the report
has to be delivered in a standard, cross-platform format.

## Project

Name: PDM

URL: https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm

A package manager for python projects.

## Onboarding experience

Did it build and run as documented?
    
See the assignment for details; if everything works out of the box,
there is no need to write much here. If the first project(s) you picked
ended up being unsuitable, you can describe the "onboarding experience"
for each project, along with reason(s) why you changed to a different one.

PDM was the first project we picked.

The project has a good CONTRIBUTING.md, where clear instructions are given
on how to organize ones contribution. The project recomends using it's own 
product (PDM) to ensure formatting and linting. Changes are documented using 
`news` fragments. 


## Complexity

1. What are your results for ten complex functions?
   * Did all methods (tools vs. manual count) get the same result?
   * Are the results clear?
2. Are the functions just complex, or also long?
3. What is the purpose of the functions?
4. Are exceptions taken into account in the given measurements?
5. Is the documentation clear w.r.t. all the possible outcomes?

## Refactoring

Plan for refactoring complex code:

Estimated impact of refactoring (lower CC, but other drawbacks?).

Carried out refactoring (optional, P+):

git diff ...

## Coverage

### Tools

Document your experience in using a "new"/different coverage tool.

How well was the tool documented? Was it possible/easy/difficult to
integrate it with your build environment?

### Your own coverage tool

Show a patch (or link to a branch) that shows the instrumented code to
gather coverage measurements.

The patch is probably too long to be copied here, so please add
the git command that is used to obtain the patch instead:

git diff ...

What kinds of constructs does your tool support, and how accurate is
its output?

### Evaluation

1. How detailed is your coverage measurement?

2. What are the limitations of your own tool?

3. Are the results of your tool consistent with existing coverage tools?

## Coverage improvement

Show the comments that describe the requirements for the coverage.

Report of old coverage: [link]

Report of new coverage: [link]

Test cases added:

git diff ...

Number of test cases added: two per team member (P) or at least four (P+).

## Self-assessment: Way of working

**Current state according to the Essence standard:** 

We are currently in the "In place" state of the Essence heirarchy. In the last assignment we also said that we were in the "In place" state. The reason for this is simply that we felt that assignment 3 went very well but without any major changes to our way of working. We kept using the well functioning routines and methods of working to the same functioning standard as before. We feel that our way of working works very well where we are able to disect a problem into smaller issues which everyone can work on independently. We also felt that this assignment was slightly more individualistic where each member was able to pursue their own tasks without being relient on another members code. Thus all group members continue to work within the same workflow autonomously. This frees up time and effort to solely focus on the issues and on solving the assignment. With regard to this some ideas as to improve the workflow are still being made even if these constitute minor changes addressing minor inefficiencies. An example of this being how we approve and squash merge pull requests. Team wise we'd say that we are currently in the "performing" phase where all team members are working comfortably together as a unit and being able to solve problems in an efficient manner. In order to further improve and achieve the next step "Working well"  when it comes to workflow we need to continue with what we're doing (in order to maintain our workflow) and focus on evaluating each assignment with constructive feedback to address issues and actively work on maintaining the effective workflow and feedback that we've built. We're looking forward to assignment 4! 

**Was the self-assessment unanimous? Any doubts about certain items?**

The self-assessment was unanimous as all team members feel that we are improving as a group with each assignment where we have good communication with each other in order to solve problems and discuss ideas.

**How have you improved so far?**

Our group has improved a lot compared to the beginning of the course. We've become a cohesive group where everyone takes initiative to tackle problems and discuss differnet methods of solving them. We're very open in our communication and feedback which has only improved the more we've worked together and gotten to know each other. Practically we've become a lot better at using GitHub in a larger group project with handling branches, merges as well as simply dissecting the assigned problems into smaller atomic issues. Compared to the beginning we've greatly improved our workflow when it comes to making Pull Requests, commenting and approving PRs along with handling and merging branches correctly. 

**Where is potential for improvement?**

There are always ways to improve and one should always be open to how we can improve, both individually and as a group. Some concrete improvements we can make are:

* We can become more articulate in the the beginning of each project with how we want to structure the project (how we'll use branches etc.). We were very good at doing this for the CI project (assignment 2) but in assignment 3 it was slightly unclear how we were going to use branches and later merge them all together. 
* We can definetly aim to include our own deadlines where we try to complete an assignment/parts of assignments to certain dates in order to have some extra time to go over everything and double check things. We have tried to do this before with some success. It is however quite difficult to do as the assignments are very new where it is very difficult to judge how long different tasks will take. 
* We can attempt to be even more articulate in our commit and PR messages.
